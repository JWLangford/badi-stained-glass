              “The adoption of a new calendar in each dispensation is a symbol
              of the power of Divine Revelation to reshape human perception of
              material, social, and spiritual reality. Through it, sacred
              moments are distinguished, humanity’s place in time and space
              reimagined, and the rhythm of life recast.” (Universal House of
              Justice 10 July 2014 letter to the Baha’is of the world)

              The architectural challenge was to create a stained glass
              structure that would enhance the light coming into the Gathering
              Room from the 2 skylights above.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The creative challenge was to create a piece of art that would
              represent the elements of the Badi’ Calendar in a beautiful way.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The Badi’ (Baha’i) Calendar is a solar calendar consisting of 19
              months of 19 days each with 4 or 5 intercalary days, depending on
              the moment of the solar equinox. “Badi’” is Arabic for wondrous or
              unique. The Baha’i community follows this calendar. The Bab
              created the elements of this new calendar between the years
              1844-1852. (see Appendix I)
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The Baha’i Era began on 21 March 1844, the year the Bab proclaimed
              His new religion. This calendar represents the year 173 B.E.
              (2016-2017); chosen because it is the year the house was
              completed.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The design combines symbolism taken from the Baha’i Writings and
              artistic inspirations of the artist.

              “The first month is the month of the Point, and the months
              belonging to the Letters of the Living revolve around it. Among
              all the months, the month of the Point resembleth the sun, while
              all other months resemble mirrors which reflect the radiant lights
              of that supreme month, in such wise that naught is seen in them
              but that month. God hath called that month the month of Baha
              (Splendour, Glory), meaning that therein lieth the splendor and
              glory of all months, and He hath singled it out for Him Whom God
              shall make manifest. Each of its days is related by God to one of
              the Letters of Unity.” (The Bab, Persian Bayan 5:3 taken from
              Saiedi, Nader “Gate of the Heart,”p. 328)
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The panel representing Baha, the first month, is oriented towards
              Bahji, the Point of Adoration, in Akka, Israel.

              The central disc of hand blown glass was created by Nathan
              Macomber of Eaton, New Hampshire. The color was chosen to
              represent, in part, the sun. The disc is also a symbol for God.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The Baha’i symbol carved into this disc includes two five-pointed
              stars, symbolizing the persons of the Bab and Baha’u’llah Who are
              the two central figures of the Baha’i Faith. The calligraphy lines
              represent the realm of God, the realm of the Messengers from God,
              and the realm of creation, with a line joining all three
              symbolizing the Word of God. The lines also spell out, in Arabic,
              “God is Most Glorious” (see Appendix II for a better and longer
              explanation)

              1. Word of God descending: The 3 clear crystals in each of the 19
              panels represent the Word of God traveling from God to the world
              of creation.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              2. Four elements: The colored circles represent the four elements:
              fire, air, water and earth. The first three months are the fire of
              God (yellow/orange), the next four months are the air of eternity
              (transparent color tones). The subsequent 6 months are the waters
              of divine unity (blue tones)…and the last 6 months pertain to
              earthly existence – the element of dust (earth tones) This
              symbolism is taken from the Persian Bayan 5:3 as quoted in Gate of
              the Heart by Nader Saiedi, p. 75.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              3. Arches: The crimson-colored arches symbolize the Arc of the
              Covenant, the Crimson-colored Arc.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              4. Green turban: The green areas near the bottom of each panel
              symbolize the green of the Bab’s turban.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              5. Days: The 19 triangles at the bottom margin of each of the 19
              panels represent the 361 days of the year. The colors chosen for
              the 361 days generally follow seasonal coloration for New England,
              with some specialty choices of the artist’s whimsy.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              6. Soltices & equinoxes: The 4 orange triangles below the ‘days’
              represent the 2 equinoxes and 2 soltices. (March 20 vernal
              equinox, June 20 summer soltice, September 22 autumnal equinox,
              December 21, 2016 winter soltice)
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              7. Gregorian months: The 12 slanting lines of copper at the very
              lowest margin of the structure represent the Gregorian (western)
              months
            </Box>

            <Box mb={2}>
              Triangles with stars represent Baha’i Holy Days. Eleven special
              days are represented: the 9 designated Holy Days and the 2 days
              commemorating ‘Abdu’l-Baha.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              The Red/stars represent the Holy Days related to Baha’u’llah:
              Baha’ullah’s Birth, the Festival of Ridvan, and Baha’u’llah’s
              Ascension.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              Green/stars represent the Holy Days related to the Bab: The Bab’s

            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              Blue/stars represent ‘Abdu’l-Baha’s birth and Day of the Covenant.

              Ayyam-i-Ha Intercalary Days Four (4) intercalary days hang just
              outside of the structure making up the total of 365 days in this
              173rd year of the Baha’i Era. Every five years or so there are 5
              intercalary days.
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              “Let the days in excess of the months be placed before the month
              of fasting. We have ordained that these, amid all nights and days,
              shall be the manifestations of the letter Ha, and thus they have
              not been bounded by the limits of the year and its months.”
              (Baha’u’llah, Kitab-i-Aqdas, 16)
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              Month of fasting: The month of Ala is the month of fasting for
              Baha’is. The triangles in this month are two-toned, with the color
              changes in each day tending upwards. Fasting occurs between the
              hours of sunrise and sunset. In the northern hemisphere, the hours
              of daylight during these 19 days of the fast grow longer as the
              month progresses, and these ascending lines symbolize the changing
              length of the time of fasting.

              The angle of slant for the frame equals 45 degrees. 4 + 5 = 9 the
              numerical value of Baha.

            <Box mb={2}>
              “The substance of this gate is that the Lord of the universe hath
              fashioned all types of years by His behest, and hath ordained that
              from the inception of the Bayan, each year should equal the
              numerical value of the words "all things" (kullu shay') [19 x 19 -
              361], to consist of nineteen months, where each month equalleth
              nineteen days, that from the moment of the rising of the sun in
              the vernal equinox -corresponding to the first sign of the Zodiac,
              the sign of Aries - till the end of its voyage at the end of
              winter - corresponding to the last sign of the Zodiac, the sign of
              Pisces - all beings may traverse through all the nineteen stages
              of the Letters of Unity.” (The Bab, Persian Bayan 5:3 taken from
              Saiedi, Nader “Gate of the Heart,” p. 327)
            </Box>
            <Box mb={2}>
              “Thus, He hath destined each day to be the springtime of one of
              His laws, that the inmates of this paradise may partake of divine
              delights in the utmost joy possible within the realm of creation.
              Therefore, during the first three months - the months of
              glorification - the fire of the hearts of existent beings is
              kindled. During the next four months - the months of the
              celebration of praise - the spirits of the contingent beings are
              created, during which time they are provided for. In the
              subsequent six months - the months of the exaltation of unity -
              God causeth the beings to expire, not as a physical death, but the
              death of negation and life in affir- mation. Finally, in the last
              six months - which are the months of magnification - the Lord of
              the universe, glorified and exalted be He, quickeneth those souls
              who have died to the love of anyone other than Him and have
              remained steadfast in His love.” (The Bab, Persian Bayan 5:3 taken
